Yes! Finally I have it done. As you might have recognized on the front page you can see **My Latest GitHub Activities!** For this task I used good ol' jQuery, underscore.js and moment.js.

## In Depth

- make links to the library.
- make the post loop look better.
- do some css work
- and finally publish this shit.
