## Hi, my name is Pete

> I am a UX engineer and creative technologist with a stong love for thought-through design systems and well-crafted frontend component libraries.

As a proud father of three fantastic girls, I live in the vivid city of Berlin. In my spare time, I like to visit exhibitions, meet friends, and learn about new things.

Nice to meet you! ðŸ˜ƒ

If youâ€™d like to know more about me you can visit [my about page](/about) or youâ€™ll revisit this site again, when I have added my projects here.

Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/PDXIII) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdxiii/).
