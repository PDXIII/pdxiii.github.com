## Hi, my name is Pete

> I am a UX engineer and creative technologist with a stong love for thought-through design systems and well-crafted frontend component libraries.

As a proud father of three fantastic girls, I live in the vivid city of Berlin. In my spare time, I like to visit exhibitions, meet friends, and learn about new things.

Nice to meet you! ðŸ˜ƒ
