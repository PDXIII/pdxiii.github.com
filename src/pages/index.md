## Hi, my name is Pete

> I am a UX & frontend engineer with a strong focus on implementing and maintaining design systems and frontend component libraries. With over a decade of experience in software design covering different roles, I am able to design and build great user interfaces, create and develop awesome teams, implement and improve processes that speed up the production cycle, and still make it feel fun!

As a proud father of three fantastic girls, I live in the vivid city of Berlin. In my spare time, I like to visit exhibitions, meet friends, and learn about new things.

Nice to meet you! ðŸ˜ƒ
