## About Me

> I am a UX engineer with over a decade of experience in software design, and I love well-crafted design systems and component libraries.

I enjoy having a family, being resourceful, and living in the vivid city of Berlin. Seeing myself also as a creative coder, I strongly believe that good design already starts with well-written source code and that the best user experience results from the combination of both. My former colleagues would probably say, that I am a team player and an eager learner.
