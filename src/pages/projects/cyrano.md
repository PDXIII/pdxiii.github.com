## Cyrano

Cyrano is a learning project by [hilarious potato](https://github.com/hilarious-potato) during our web development bootcamp at [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/). It provides users a simple way to share encrypted messages. The process of encryption and decryption happens entirely in the frontend. That has brought up a few challenges for us. Maybe, we havenâ€™t solved them entirely on CIA level, but it works ðŸ’ª!
