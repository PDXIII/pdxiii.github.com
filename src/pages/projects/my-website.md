I’ve managed to set up the skeleton of my future website. It uses Astro and Tailwind CSS so far. And I’ve added a custom font: Fabrikat Kompakt. Deployment to GitHub pages worked, too. Very happy!

I have some issues with my domain `petersekan.de`. Haven’t managed to solve it entirely, but at least the website is available on [pdxiii.github.io](https://pdxiii.github.io/).

I’ve added Anime.js to the project, and it works nicely. About Astro I’ve learned how to fetch posts and build a navigation list with it. And I’ve added some content, like this post here.

The website looks currently like this:

Yay, my custom domain is working! This page is now available under [peterekan.de](https://peterekan.de). That’s pretty great and would have made my day, if today wasn’t already awesome!

A few hours have passed and I’ve worked on the website. I have added a dash of color and fixed the default type styling for Markdown content.

The website looks like this right now:

I think it is at a point where I can show it and focus again on the projects, because the things I’ve learned about Astro.js and Anime.js want me to apply them. But it would be a total overload for this here. The game project is the right thing for this and would apreciate a re-write.
