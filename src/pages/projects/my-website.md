I’ve managed to set up the skeleton of my future website. It uses Astro and Tailwind CSS so far. And I’ve added a custom font: Fabrikat Kompakt. Deployment to GitHub pages worked, too. Very happy!

I have some issues with my domain `petersekan.de`. Haven’t managed to solve it entirely, but at least the website is available on [pdxiii.github.io](https://pdxiii.github.io/).

I’ve added Anime.js to the project, and it works nicely. About Astro I’ve learned how to fetch posts and build a navigation list with it. And I’ve added some content, like this post here.

The website looks currently like this:
