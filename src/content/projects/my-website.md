I’ve managed to set up the skeleton of my future website. It uses Astro and Tailwind CSS so far. And I’ve added a custom font: Fabrikat Kompakt. Deployment to GitHub pages worked, too. Very happy!

I have some issues with my domain `petersekan.de`. Haven’t managed to solve it entirely, but at least the website is available on [pdxiii.github.io](https://pdxiii.github.io/).

I’ve added Anime.js to the project, and it works nicely. About Astro I’ve learned how to fetch posts and build a navigation list with it. And I’ve added some content, like this post here.

The website looks currently like this:

Yay, my custom domain is working! This page is now available under [peterekan.de](https://peterekan.de). That’s pretty great and would have made my day, if today wasn’t already awesome!

A few hours have passed and I’ve worked on the website. I have added a dash of color and fixed the default type styling for Markdown content.

The website looks like this right now:

I think it is at a point where I can show it and focus again on the projects, because the things I’ve learned about Astro.js and Anime.js want me to apply them. But it would be a total overload for this here. The game project is the right thing for this and would apreciate a re-write.

Today, I’ve added a license to the repository and a [now page](http://petersekan.de/now) to the website. Now, I will take a look into an Astro tutorial about structuring content better. Let’s see if I will do that.

> Look, mum, I made an responsive navigation bar!

Finally, I’ve built it. Instead of using the hamburger menu pattern, the mobile navigation sits at the bottom of the page. Always revealing its full content. I know this pattern might not applicable for all use case, but it works here pretty well.

The website looks like this:

A little bit of tweeking the links’ style was also a minor improvement.
