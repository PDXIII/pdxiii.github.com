Today, I’ve added analytics by [PostHog](https://posthog.com) to this page. It tracks usage without cookkies, is hosted in the EU, and it is open source. Three things I like about it. Let’s see if the data makes me any wiser.

In addition to that, I’ve helped my colleague [Marin Valenta](https://marinvalenta.com/) with some design advices on his project that is hopefully published soon. He has done an amazing job. And I am very impressed how much determination, sweat, and blood he has put into it. Besides that, I am impressed how much he cares about user guidance. On every screen he has added hints what needs to be done. That’s amazing and I am really looking forward to the moment when he publishes it.
