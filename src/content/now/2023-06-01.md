## Checklist For My Site

It is probably time to make a checklist of what I want to add to my site before it goes out of hand.

- dark theme
- components for:
  - thoughts index and pages
  - now index and pages
- better navigation
- nicer links
- add downloadable CVs
- rewrite **About Me** page
- rewrite **Index** page
- redesign **Index** page
- add images to projects and thoughts

Instead of focusing on these topics, I finally added two more articles to my site. Thatâ€™s something.
