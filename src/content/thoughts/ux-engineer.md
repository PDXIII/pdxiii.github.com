## What Does A UX Engineer Do?

UX engineers combine the mindset UI/UX designers with the craftsmanship of frontend engineers. As part of the product design team they are highly engaged with building and maintaining design systems and the related frontend component libraries in source code. For UX research and usability testing they build high fidelity prototypes that work and feel like the real software to gain better insights from the users’ perspective.

They can help design ops in improving processes by providing systematic thinking and automization if possible or customization of plugins for design tools.

Because they know they technical restrictions of the platform they are focusing on, they can estimate the technical efforts of visual designs and suggest possible compromises to achieve the best possible user experience in the given time frame and improve the understanding of these restrictions among designers.

They promote the use of the company’s frontend component library among engineers by giving detailed information about usage and application.

While frontend engineers foremost focus on data flow and performance UX engineers concentrate on accessibility, including semantical HTML, consistency, and the correct implementation of the visual design.
