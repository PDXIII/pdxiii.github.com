## Should designers code?

In my opinion¬†**YES**!

Maybe not bullet proofed production-ready code, but the better they can code the better. From my perspective designers should be able to deliver at least the markup and the style in code for the platform they are designing for. I would love to see more designers who broke free from the constraints of the common static graphic editors.

Please don‚Äôt get me wrong. I understand the benefits of a graphic editor when it comes to sketch something out and iterate over an idea. But it blocks us from understanding the nature of the medium we are designing for.

After having said this let‚Äôs come back to the topic. How to start learning to code?

The best practice is learning by doing by using the resources the web provides to us. But it is easy to drown in that ocean of information, right?

So, to your comfort, I‚Äôve put together this list of resources. May it help you on your way becoming¬†*a designer who codes!*

## Codecademy

In my opinion,¬†**Codecademy**¬†is a great place to start. All linked sites listed here offer a few free courses or are a free course.

### [JavaScript Courses & Tutorials | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript)

On this site the most relevant courses, in my opinion, are¬†[Learn JavaScript,](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)¬†[Learn React.js: Part I,](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)¬†and¬†[Learn React.js: Part II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102). The first will give you an overview of the language and the other two will teach you about the¬†*now to go with*¬†framework.

Very handy is this cheat sheet about¬†[JavaScript basics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-video-games-with-phaser/tracks/game-dev-learn-javascript-basics/modules/game-dev-learn-javascript-basics/cheatsheet)¬†and maybe¬†[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8PlcR-4GRQ)¬†provides a nice introduction.

### [Learn HTML | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

This basic HTML course only takes 9 hours to master. And here you‚Äôll find a¬†[glossary](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-html)¬†and¬†[cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-elements/cheatsheet)¬†supporting this.

### [Learn CSS | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

This basic CSS course only takes 15 hours to master. And here you‚Äôll find a¬†[glossary](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-css)¬†and¬†[cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css/modules/learn-css-selectors-visual-rules/cheatsheet)¬†supporting this. Do I have a deja-v√π ü§î?

### [Use DevTools | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/use-devtools)

A good part of a web developer‚Äôs life is spent with tooling. Let it be versioning, linting, building, etc. There is a lot and too much to cover all of this here, but most important for the start are the browser‚Äôs dev tools. Take a look at¬†[this resource](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/use-devtools)¬†and learn them.

## Udemy

**Udemy** is another online learning platform. It covers more topics than Codecademy and doesn‚Äôt only concentrate on coding.¬†**And**¬†it doesn‚Äôt offer so many free courses.¬†**But**¬†I know that they offer crazy discounts once a year (might be Black Friday). So, watch out!

### [Free Tutorial ‚Äì Foundations of Front-End Web Development | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/foundations-of-front-end-development/)

The description promises that after finishing this 20 hours¬†*video-on-demand*¬†course you could apply for the position of a Junior Front End Developer. Honestly, I doubt that but it should give you a better understand, and on the other hand who knows?

## Khan Academy

> We‚Äôre a nonprofit with the mission to provide free world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

That‚Äôs ambitious! I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but occasionally have heard from it. They cover a lot of school or general educational topics but also some business and job topics as well.

### [Computer Programming | Computing | Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)

As I mentioned, I haven‚Äôt tried any of their courses before and this here is somehow¬†*game focused.*¬†So, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking this course from start to end.¬†**But**¬†I like how they split up their¬†**Intro to JS.**¬†By having such a clean table of content it is easy to pick a topic that you may still struggle with and want to consult another resource. And I appreciate that they paid special attention to the topics¬†[Writing clean code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#writing-clean-code)¬†\***\*and¬†[Becoming a better programmer](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#good-practices)**.\*\*

## [MDN Web Docs | moz://a](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

> Our leadership has been at the forefront of building a healthier internet since Day 1. What began as an alternative to corporate domination has grown into a global force for good online.

Welcome to one of the pioneers of the open web üòª! Aside from delivering one of the best browsers available they contribute to a lot of open-source projects and try to make the internet a better and more inclusive place. They provide great¬†[references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference)¬†covering all kinds of web topics, too.

### [Learn Web Development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

The aim of this area of **MDN** is not to take you from¬†*beginner*¬†to¬†*expert*¬†but to take you from¬†*beginner*¬†to¬†*comfortable*.

I have no idea how long this course takes but it is built on top of one of the most reliable resources you can find on the net.

## edX | Platform For Education And Learning

### [Front-End Web Developer Professional Certificate | edX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/w3cx-front-end-web-developer)

This course isn‚Äôt announced as free but what I heard is that you only have to pay for the certificate and that you can do the course for free.

This course is more focused on HTML and CSS but must be quite intense because it says that it takes 7 months when you spend 5 ‚Äì 7 hours per week.¬†**But it is W3C certified!**¬†This could only be topped if Tim Berners-Lee himself would give you your certificate.

If you don‚Äôt know what the W3C or Tim Berners-Lee are ‚Äì shame on you!

## [20 Best Free Web Development Course & Certification \[2020 UPDATED\]](https://digitaldefynd.com/best-free-web-development-courses-tutorials-certification/)

In addition to my list, I want to mention this list here. There are is a bit of overlap but like one of my tutors at the [FHP](https://www.fh-potsdam.de) used to say: ‚ÄúSometimes redundancy is nice!‚Äù Take a look and pick yourself.

## [LevelUpTuts | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LevelUpTuts/featured)

Scott Tolinski is a hero! That guy can show you everything regarding web development and makes it look easy. Good thing that he keeps recording everything. If you have reached a level of a certain understanding of the basics and you want to take a look into a new development framework Scott‚Äôs tutorials are highly recommended.

LevelUpTuts is also offering paid courses through¬†[its website.](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/)

## [Roadmap: Learn To Become A Modern Front End Developer](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)

Front end development is a wide field. If you want to know how much there is to learn then follow¬†[this link](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). But to be honest, you don‚Äôt need to understand everything, especially not as a designer. But I think it makes sense to take a look at it and see what you can learn next.
