This is the repository of my [GitHub user page](http://pdxiii.github.io/). It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and makes use of the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to display my activity in my own and other repositories. If you would like to know more about this read my post: [Added GitHub Activities]({{ site.baseurl}}/update/2016/03/24/added-github-activities.html).

While I publish my own code under [MIT License]({{ site.baseurl }}/license/) other assets, like graphics, images and fonts may underly some sort of copyright. Please respect that and check it out before you use them.
