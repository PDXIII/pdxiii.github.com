Hi, my name is Peter Sekan, I am a designer, coder, hacker working and living in Berlin! I made my Bachelor of Arts in [interface design](http://interface.fh-potsdam.de/showcase/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP)](http://fh-potsdam.de). 

As a interface designer, I feel comfortable in the fields of web and mobile UX & UI design.  But I love to experiment and explore digital design with code. Often influenced by my strong affinity to typography.

On this website, you can get an overview over my code related projects. Some are serious web projects, others are more tongue in cheek.

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate and contact me via [mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}).

Best regards,
Pete
